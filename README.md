# kql_searches

I am starting to learn KQL, why? Because I want to be able to do more with the cloud and not continue to fall behind. These searches will most likely be simple and you might know of a better way or a way to improve the search. If that is the case. Add a note. The only thing I ask is that you be kind and respectful. This world and the security industry already has enough divas and self-rightous people, you do not need to add to the list. :-)
